# ENABLING PHP ON A WEBSITE

### By default, an HTML file will take precedence over a PHP file as the defaul is always HTML and will always take precedence over a home PHP file.

### To enable a PHP file we need to do the followings:

### 1. You need to change the order of the file in which the PHP file is listed in the directory 

`sudo vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf`

### <IfModule mod_dir.c>
        #Change this:
        #DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
        #To this:
        DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>


### 2. Save and close the above file.


### 3. After saving the file, we will need to uplaod Apache for the changes to take effect using:

`sudo systemctl reload apache2`


### 4. Finally, we will create a PHP script to test that PHP is correctly installed and configured on your server.

### Now that I have a custom location to host my website’s files and folders, I then need to create a PHP test script to confirm that Apache is able to handle and process requests for PHP files.

### 5. Create a new file named index.php inside my custom web root folder:

`vim /var/www/projectlamp/index.php`

### This will open a blank file. I then add the following text, which is valid PHP code, inside the file:


### `<?php
### phpinfo();`

### 6. After checking the relevant information about the PHP server through the above page, it’s best to remove the file  created as it contains sensitive information about the PHP environment -and my Ubuntu server. You can use rm to do so:
`sudo rm /var/www/projectlamp/index.php`

### This page can always be recreated to access the information later.
