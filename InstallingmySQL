# INSTALLING MYSQL

### The second phase involves installing a database that will store all the data that will be displayed by the Apache when requested by the user/client.

### To do this, we need to run some codes in stages.


### Again we use apt command to install the Database

`$ sudo apt install mysql-server`

### When download is completed, one can log in by running the sudo command again:
`$ sudo mysql`

### Once done, you can interact with the database by runnung:

`$ sudo mysql_secure_installation`
